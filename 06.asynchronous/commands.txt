1. In a synchronous program one line runs after another. Like we have 2 console.log.

2. In asynchronous program:
  console.log('Starting');
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('2 Seconds timer')
  }, 2000);
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('0 Seconds timer')
  }, 0);
  console.log('Stopping');

  - main() is called in Call Stack
  - console.log('Starting') is called in Call Stack and gets removed when its complete
  - setTimeout(..., 2000) is pushed to Call Stack
    When we call setTimeout() it's registering an event with NodeJS API, where the event is to wait 2 seconds 
    and the callback is the function to run 
  - setTimeout(..., 0) is pushed to Call Stack
    This will register another event in NodeJS API, where the event is 0 seconds 

  When a event is done is send to Callback Queue
  - o seconds event is finished so the setTimeout function is send to Callback Queue 
  This callback needs to be executed but before that the Event Loop looks if the Call Stack is empty. In this point Call Stack
  is not empty, because has the main() function, so the callback cann't be executed now.
  - console.log('Stopping') is called to Call Stack, print out the messege and gets removed from Call Stack
  - in this moment main() is removed, because there is no more code.
  - now the Event Loop sees that the Call Stack is empty and moves the callback(0) in Call Stack
  - callback(0) will run, will add console.log in Call Stack and will removed after printing out the message, and callback(0) 
  will be removed from Call Stack
  - callback(2sec) is added to Callback Queue after finished 2 seconds, Event Loop will add it to Call Stack, because is empty
  - callback(2sec) will run, the console.log will be added to Call Stack and removed..., and callback(2sec) is removed, too

  Node uses other treads, behind the scene, for those Node APIs, so that is why Node is non blocking, allowing othere process
  to finish, even we are waiting 2 seconds for other process
